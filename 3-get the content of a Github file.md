So our goal was working with Github, among other things, so we first had to get the content of a Github file. So we implemented a function called[ `get_github_file_content` ](https://github.com/HamidrezaRahimian/Github-discussion-reviewer/blob/main/notebooks/Test2.py) that retrieves the content of a file from a GitHub repository. Here is an explanation of the code:

- The function takes four parameters: `username` (GitHub username), `repository` (repository name), `branch` (branch name), and `file_path` (path to the file in the repository).
- It constructs the URL for the GitHub API endpoint to retrieve the content of the specified file.
- The code sends a GET request to the GitHub API using the constructed URL.

- If the request is successful (status code 200), it extracts the JSON data from the response and retrieves the Base64-encoded content 
   of the file.
- The Base64-encoded content is then decoded using the `base64.b64decode` function and converted into readable text.
- The decoded content is returned by the function.
- If the request is not successful, an error message with the status code is printed.

The code also includes an example usage where the function is called with specific GitHub username, repository name, branch name, and file path values. The retrieved file content is printed.

In summary, the code provides a way to retrieve the content of a file from a GitHub repository using the GitHub API and decode the Base64-encoded content.
