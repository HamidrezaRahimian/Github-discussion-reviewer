Welcome to our project on GitHub about GitHub! ðŸ˜„

What are the goals of our project?

We aim to create a user-friendly website that enables users to access their GitHub profile and view various pieces of information about their account. Users should be able to manage their discussions and receive feedback on their blog entries, such as identifying spelling mistakes or formatting issues. Ultimately, our goal is to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their GitHub profile and ensure that their blog entries are well-written and well-structured.

For our project, we will primarily use the programming languages Python, HTML, and CSS. We may also incorporate other languages for specific details, but Python will be our main focus. Additionally, we will be working with the GitHub API for the first time.

"Curious? Take a look inside and prepare to be amazed!" ðŸ˜®âœ¨
